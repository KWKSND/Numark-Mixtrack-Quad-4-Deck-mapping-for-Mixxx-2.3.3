Hate the colors i picked?
Look in the .xml file about 2/3 of the way down it switches from <control> to <output> this is where you can change colors :D
Look for:
	<output>
		<group>[EffectRack1_EffectUnit1]</group>
               	<key>group_[Channel1]_enable</key>
                <status>0x91</status>
                <midino>0x5C</midino>
                <on>0x02</on>
                <off>0x05</off>
                <maximum>0</maximum>
	</output>
The 0x05 above is the color green when the app and pad is in the off position

Apply the codes from the above colors list but beware.
If you change the colors in the .xml you may also have to change colors in the .js
At the bottom of the NumarkMixTrackQuad.lightShow function after line 600 
Look for:
	// Sets Reset LEDs to match .xml
	engine.beginTimer(4400, "midi.sendShortMsg(0x91, 0x5C, 5)", true);
The 5 above is the color green

It will be best if the color matches after the intro so youre all ready to dj

Yes pay close attention these 2 bits of code refer to the same pad on the controller
In the .xml the Mixxx app and what the pad does defines what the group is called
	<group>[EffectRack1_EffectUnit1]</group>
But
The in the .js i grouped the code so its using the name of the button on the controller itself
	// Sets Reset LEDs to match .xml
It's easier to read "Reset LEDs" than to read 0x91, 0x5C lol

The easiest way to do a color change might be to decide your pads resting colors in the .js
Take note of the old colors you remove and what you replced them with
Then in the bottom 2/3 of the .xml search for the old color codes you removed and update them to match
Make sure they are the same pad and in the same state on/off etc
Its not too hard, but it also not to hard to mess it up lol, make backups.
