- I agree with the above statement.
- You guys drove my O.C.D. crazy enough to get it done for everyone thanks for the inspiration.
- I had not worked with midi or javascript, still more done in the last week or so than all you in 12 years ROFL
- I hope many people get to enjoy this wonderful controller for years to come without being robbed by VDJ

- Whats new?
-  Incorrectly mapped buttons were found and fixed
-  FX123 & Filter knob speed is fixed
-  Pressing shift + turning FX123 knobs now change what effects are assigned to the pads
-  Pressing shift + turning FXF knobs now mix the dry / wet level of the FX123 unit
-  Pressing shift + keylock now enables / disables keylock
-  Pressing shift + Range now scales the range of the pitch slider
-  Pressing left shift + right shift now enables / disables AutoDJ (option, preference, AutoDJ, add random tracks)
-  AutoDJ now auto enabled with nice slow fade in when Mixxx starts so you can start Mixxx and walk away
-  Soft takeover added to all sliders and knobs, so there is no more extreme jumps in volumes or filters etc
-  Jogwheel direction when not in scratch mode was wrong now fixed
-  Fixed some timer kill errors
-  New colors on most pads
-  Beautiful LED intro on Mixxx startup
-  Idle mode added to keep the LED show going until you start DJing, also now resumes if idle again
-  Improved controls and LED animation with scratching especially in reverse
-  LEDs now work with scratching and stop with end of track
-  Added master clipping indicators to the folder / file LEDs to keep you from blowing your shit up
-  Added channel clipping indicators to the headphone LEDs for each channel to prevent overdoing it on the EQ
-  Shutdown function added to turn off all possible LEDs with Mixxx app shutdown
-  Stutter flashes the BPM and Cue flashes to indicate 30 seconds from end of track
-  And finally i get to announce all jogwheel LEDs now work without having to press play on the controller :D
-  Hit play on the controller, or with the mouse on the Mixxx app, or let AutoDJ do it for you it all works YES!!!
