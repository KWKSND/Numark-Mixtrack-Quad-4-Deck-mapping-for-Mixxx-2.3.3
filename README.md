# Numark Mixtrack Quad 4 Deck mapping for Mixxx 2.3.3
A fork of Datlaunchystark's scripts with improved LED function

If you're on Windows, add the files to:
`C:\Users\(User)\AppData\Local\Mixxx\controllers`

Or if you're on Mac:
`Applications/Mixxx.app/Contents/Resources/controllers`

Whats New?
  - New Colors on Most Pads
  - Fully Animated LEDs, Beautiful intro on Mixxx startup, LEDs work with scratching, end of track, and AutoDJ
  - Shutdown function added to turn off all possible LEDs with Mixxx app shutdown 
  - Improved controls and LED animation with scratching especially in reverse
  - FX 123 knobs now change what effect is assigned to the pad, 4th knob still controls gain so it works great
  
Features:
  - Supports 4 decks
  - Library Browse knob + Load A/B
  - Channel volume, cross fader, cue gain / mix, Master gain, filters, pitch and pitch bend
  - Scratch/CD mode toggle
  - Headphone output toggle 
  - Samples (Using 16 samples)
  - Effects (Using 4 effect units)
  - Cue
  - 1-4. Hot cue
  - Loops
    - (1) Loop in (Loop halves)
    - (2) Loop out (Loop double)
    - (3) Re-loop (Starts loop at current playback point)
    - (4) Loop Delete (Deactivates loop)
    
Known Bugs:
  -	Each slide/knob needs to be moved on Mixxx startup to match levels with the Mixxx UI.
  - LEDs wont animate on deck 2 with AutoDJ? 
    (Load track in deck 2, play deck 2(controller), click AutoDJ)
