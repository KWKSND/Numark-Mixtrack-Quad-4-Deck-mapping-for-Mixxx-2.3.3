- I agree with the above statement.
- I had not worked with midi or javascript, still more done in the last week than you all did in 12 years ROFL
- You all drove my O.C.D. crazy enough to get it done for everyone thanks for the inspiration.
- I hope many people get to enjoy this wonderfull controller for years to come without being robbed by VDJ

- Whats New?
-  New colors on most pads
-  Fully animated LEDs
-  Beautiful intro on Mixxx startup
-  Idle mode added to keep the LED show going until you start DJing also now resumes if idle again
-  LEDs work with scratching, end of track, and AutoDJ
-  Improved controls and LED animation with scratching especially in reverse
-  Shutdown function added to turn off all possible LEDs with Mixxx app shutdown
-  FX 123 knobs now change what effects are assigned to the pads, 4th knob still controls filter so it works great
-  Incorrectly mapped buttons were found and fixed
-  Jogwheel direction when not in scratch mode was wrong now fixed
-  Fixed some timer kill spam
-  Added master clipping indicators to the folder/file LEDs to keep you from blowing your shit up
-  Added channel clipping indicators to the headphone LEDs for each channel to pevent overdoing it on the EQ
-  AutoDJ now auto enabled with nice slow fade in when Mixxx starts so you can start Mixxx and walk away
-  Stutter the flashes BPM and Cue now flashes to indicate 30 seconds from end of track
-  And finally i get to announce all jogwheel LEDs now work without having to press play on the controller :D
-  Hit play on the controller, or with the mouse on the Mixxx app, or let AutoDJ do it for you it all works YES!!!
-  Filter knob speed is fixed
-  Soft Takeover added to all slider and knob bindings, no more extreme jumps in volumes or rates
-

-
- Known Bugs:
-  Each slide/knob needs to be moved on Mixxx startup to match levels with the Mixxx UI
-
- What could still be done?
-  I may add support for the shift buttons but not sure there is any reason
