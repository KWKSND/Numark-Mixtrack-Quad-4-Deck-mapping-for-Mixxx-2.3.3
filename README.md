# Numark Mixtrack Quad 4 Deck mapping for Mixxx 2.3.3
A fork of einaralex's mapping with extra functionality.

If you're on Windows, add the files to:
`C:\Users\(User)\AppData\Local\Mixxx\controllers`

Or if you're on Mac:
`Applications/Mixxx.app/Contents/Resources/controllers`

- Supports 4 decks

- Library Browse knob + Load A/B

- Channel volume, cross fader, cue gain / mix, Master gain, filters, pitch and pitch bend

- JogWheel (IMPROVED Animated LEDs now work with scratching, end of track, play deck 1 and 2 then click pause on one then click autoDJ it works too!! :D)

- Scratch/CD mode toggle

- Headphone output toggle 

- Samples (Using 16 samples)

- Effects (Using 4 effect units)

- Cue

- 1-4. Hot cue

- Loops

  - (1) Loop in (Loop halves)

  - (2) Loop out (Loop double)

  - (3) Re-loop (Starts loop at current playback point)

  - (4) Loop Delete (Deactivates loop)

- Sync

- Most of the LEDs are functional too. :)


Known Bugs:
-	Each slide/knob needs to be moved on Mixxx startup to match levels with the Mixxx UI.
- Reverse button (mapped to 'Stutter') sometimes stickes on until repressed when stopped.
